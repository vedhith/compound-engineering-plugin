 * Coverage of every shipped skill is not a goal.
 *
 * Required-read vs body-owned gate:
 * - Omit `files_read_post` when the always-loaded body still states the gate.
 *   Skipping the reference is allowed (the correct negative). Extra reads are not a fail.
 * - Do not add `must_not_read`. Reading a procedure manual is never the defect.
